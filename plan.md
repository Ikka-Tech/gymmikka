# Project Title: Employee Onboarding and Wellness Chatbot

## MVP Requirements

### 1. New Joiner Health Information Collection

- As part of the onboarding process, the system should collect health information from new joiners to ensure a comprehensive understanding of their well-being.

### 2. Thread Generation for New Joiners

- A new thread should automatically be generated for each new joiner, providing a dedicated space for communication and information exchange throughout their onboarding journey.

### 3. User Interaction with the Chatbot

- Users should have the ability to engage in conversations with the chatbot, enabling them to ask questions, seek assistance, and receive relevant information regarding company policies, procedures, and general inquiries.

### 4. Gym Timing Data Collection

- During the onboarding process, the system should gather data regarding the preferred timing for gym activities from users. Subsequently, the chatbot should remind and encourage users to attend the gym based on their specified time preferences.

These MVP requirements aim to create a seamless onboarding experience, foster communication through dedicated threads, facilitate interaction with the chatbot for information retrieval, and promote employee wellness by integrating gym timing reminders into the system.
